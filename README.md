# plantum-cli

> **Status:** Early development - not ready for public use.  
> Internal repository for building the Sprout.js command-line interface.

## Overview
The Plantum CLI provides commands to generate apps, components, services, and further extensible building blocks using a minimal, flexible scaffolding workflow.

## Goals (v0.1)
- Basic project scaffolding (`seed`)
- Component generation (`leaf`)
- Service generation (planned)
- Automatic component registration in `app.js`
- Initial support for `grow`, to start the lightweight Kestrel-based development server

## Notes
This repository is private until the initial CLI structure and core commands reach a stable v0.1.
