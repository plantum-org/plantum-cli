# plantum-cli

> **Status:** Early development - not ready for public use.

## Overview
The Plantum CLI provides commands to generate apps, components, services, and further extensible building blocks using a minimal, flexible scaffolding workflow.

## Goals (v0.1)
- Basic project scaffolding (`seed`)
- Component generation (`leaf`)
- Service generation
- Automatic component registration in `app.js`
- Initial support for `grow`, to start the lightweight development server

## Notes

Aim to reach a clean and stable **v0.1** of the CLI - including the initial directory structure, core commands (`seed`, `leaf`, `grow`) and the basic scaffolding flow - **by the end of the year**.

Once published, the CLI can be installed via npm:

```
npm install -g @plantum-org/cli
```
